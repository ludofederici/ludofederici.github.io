								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<h3>Past, Present, and Future</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Born and raised in Italy, at 13 years old I moved with my family to London (where I did IGCSEs at Dulwich College and then the IB at Sevenoaks School). After finishing high school I was looking to embark on a new challenge, hence I packed for California and started this exciting journey at Cal.</p>
								<span class="image left"><img src="images/LF recent headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;"> At UC Berkeley, I am a junior double majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive Science, and minoring in Data Science. This past spring, I received the Saturdja Center Certificate in Entrepreneurship and Technology. In the future, I aspire to be a software engineer and technical product manager, before launching my own startup once the right opportunity arises; the next chapter of my life at Cal will be key to initiating a smooth transition from academic to professional life.</p>
								<h3>Skills</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">A dedicated, organized and methodical individual, I am an excellent team worker and a confident yet humble leader. Thanks to the symbiosis between my wide range of technical skills and my business-focused mindset, I am able to both identify opportunities and guide their implementations. My time management skills make me very reliable and allow me to have an active and dynamic approach to work and getting things done, driven by determination and consistency.</p>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/VR.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">My biggest strength lies in my insatiable curiosity paired with my willigness to always learn something new, a trait that has consistently propelled my personal and professional development. A fast learner who is always hungry for new knowledge, I can adapt to evolving situations and deliver creative solutions. By quickly grasping the essence of various subjects, I am able to connect ideas across different domains, fostering innovation and a holistic approach to problem-solving. I love being out of my comfort zone and am always up for a challenge!</p>
								<h3>Fitness and Wellbeing</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">A firm believer in the importance of looking after one's body and mind and having a good balance in all aspects of life, I love everything related to fitness and wellbeing - from nutrition to sports and working out. Staying active is a priority for me, since it helps me focus and improves my mood and sleep.</p>
								<span class="image left"><img src="images/basketball.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Growing up, I enjoyed many different sports and ended up focusing on basketball to play it at a relatively high level. In the last year, I have committed to consistent weight lifting and boxing; however, I never give up an invite to play soccer or basketball in Berkeley's Intramural League.</p>
								<h3>Traveling</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">I am fond of traveling and immersing myself in new cultures: my international upbringing makes me very open-minded. In my opinion, speaking to locals while traveling is the most valuable form of education there is - everywhere I go, I try to learn something new to take back to my everyday life.</p>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/costa rica.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;"> Some of my favourite travels include exploring the values of the Buddhist philosophy in Japan, Thailand and Burma, backpacking around Spain during the Camino de Santiago with my family, and getting lost in Costa Rica's tropical jungle with my friends. Nature is very central to my destinations.</p>

						<!-- Projects -->
							<article id="projects">
								<h2 class="major">Coding Projects</h2>
								<p>This section highlights many of the technical projects I invested time in, listed and described in reverse cronological order. Source code is available upon request.</p>
								<hr \>
								<h3>Video Focus with EEG | MUSE S, Python, OpenAI API, React Native</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/video_eeg.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">In this hackathon-winning project, we utilized the <b>Muse S 4-channel EEG Headset</b> to make online lectures more understandable. After receving signals from the headset, we effectively filtered EEG signals using <b>Python</b> to detect when the viewer is paying attention or is confused by the content. At the end of the video, the program feeds the video transcript into an <b>OpenAI API</b> model to summarize and simplify content from sections where user focus was below a chosen threshold, to aid the comprehension of confusing information.</p>
								<hr \ style="border-bottom: dotted 1.5px;">
								<h3>CNN Model to Assess Severity of Breast Cancer from Biopsy Images | Python, scikit-learn, Seaborn</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/prediction_diagram.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Using <b>Python</b> and its <b>scikit-learn</b> library, I built an artificial intelligence-based diagnostic tool to identify future high-risk breast cancer cases based on biopsy images. Then, <b>Seaborn</b> helped me carry out data visualization to evaluate the success of the 10-epoch convolutional neural network machine learning model.</p>
								<hr \ style="border-bottom: dotted 1.5px;">
								<h3>Database Management System (DBMS) Implementation | Java, SQL, NoSQL (JSON)</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/dbms.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">After taking a bare-bones database implementation which only supported executing simple transactions in series, I used <b>Java</b> to implement B+ tree indices, efficient join algorithms, <b>SQL</b> & <b>NoSQL</b> query optimization, multigranularity locking to allow concurrent execution of transactions, and database recovery.</p>
								<hr \ style="border-bottom: dotted 1.5px;">
								<h3>Portfolio Website | SCSS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/website_ss.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">I adapted a basic template to my own personal experiences and minimalistic style, while learning the foundations of web development in <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>. Thanks to this project, I also experimented with icon ideation and design, and created one to represent my initials and my brand.</p>
								<hr \ style="border-bottom: dotted 1.5px;">
								<h3>Parallelized Convolutions | C</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/convolve-2d.svg" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">To begin with, I wrote a program in <b>C</b> able to handle 2D convolutions. Then, I optimized with the implementation of parallelism, leading to a 10x performance speedup. In particular, I used <b>OpenMPI</b> directives for process-level parallelism, <b>OpenMP</b> directives for thread-level parallelism, and <b>SIMD</b> instructions for data-level parallelism.</p>
								<hr \ style="border-bottom: dotted 1.5px;">
								<h3>Central Processing Unit (CPU) | Logisim</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cpu.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Using <b>Logisim</b>, I designed a 2-stage pipelined CPU capable of running <b>RISC-V</b> instructions. This project involved implementing the function of all datapath components, and then of the <b>datapath</b> itself (pictured above). The <b>2-stage pipeline</b> allows the datapath to work on 2 different assembly code instructions simultaneously.</p>
								<hr \ style="border-bottom: dotted 1.5px;">
								<h3>Assembly Language Classifier | RISC-V</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/MNIST.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">I wrote an <b>assembly code</b> system to classify handwritten digits with a simple machine learning algorithm (Artificial Neural Net) - following Berkeley-developed Instruction Set Architecture <b>RISC-V</b>. I learnt how to allocate memory on stack and heap, use registers efficiently, write functions and follow calling convention.</p>
								<hr \ style="border-bottom: dotted 1.5px;">
								<h3>2D World | Java</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/BYOW.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Working through every stage of development from ideation to presentation, I created an engine in <b>Java</b> for generating 2D tile-based explorable worlds; the software builds a world which the user can explore by walking around. The game starts with the display of a <b>User Interface</b> which allows users to create a new world, save a loaded one or replay past movements.</p>
								<hr \ style="border-bottom: dotted 1.5px;">
								<h3>NGram Explorer | Java, JavaScript, HTML</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ngram.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">I constructed a browser-based tool  to allow users to explore the history of word usage in published English texts. The data analysis back end for this tool was written in <b>Java</b> and relies on <b>Time Series</b> and nested <b>TreeMaps</b>, while the front end code in <b>Javascript</b> and <b>HTML</b> collects user inputs and displays a visualization of outputs.</p>
								<hr \ style="border-bottom: dotted 1.5px;">
								<h3>Scheme Interpreter | Python</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/scheme.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Created during the 1970s at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman, <b>Scheme</b> is a dialect of the Lisp family of programming languages. Using <b>Python</b>, I developed an interpreter for the <b>Scheme</b> language, able to recursively evaluate <b>Scheme</b> expressions.</p>
								<hr \ style="border-bottom: dotted 1.5px;">
								<h3>Blackjack | Python</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/blackjack_board.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">My first real project, I coded a terminal-based version of Blackjack using <b>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</b> in <b>Python</b>. The program allows for standard game functionality, including betting with a chosen starting balance. </p>

								<p style="text-align: justify;">I traveled <b>4 times for 2-week-long periods each to the NPH foster home in the Dominican Republic</b>, where I helped build houses for volunteers to stay, taught English lessons, and engaged in sports and activities with kids.</br>
								</br>
									While in Europe, I received guests at 3 fundraising events at Teatro Alla Scala (Milan), Bulgari Hotel, and Sumosan Twiga (London), during which <b>I set up 3 auctions to collect money for NPH's 9 foster homes across Central America</b>.</p>

							<h4>About EduSpots STEM</h4>
							<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>EduSpots is a Ghanaian and UK registered NGO, which exists to connect, train, and equip over 250 local volunteers who drive community-led change in Ghana through education spaces named ‘Spots’</b>.
								The ‘Spots’ are led and owned by community committees comprising local educational leaders, traditional leaders, political leaders, teachers, students and parents.
								The Ghanaian staff team lead programmes in leadership, STEM and literacy development, enabling local volunteers to impact an estimated 15,000 learners annually. Students start to echo the volunteerism they benefit from, creating a world in which communities unite to create the futures they want to see, through education.</p>

								<h4>Video Producer
								<span style="float:right;">
									Aug. 2017 - May 2021</h4>
								</span>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">I promoted STEM education by <b>creating, directing, and editing 12 science experiment videos</b> based only on easily available equipment for children in remote communities in Ghana to recreate without the need for expensive tools.</br>
								</br>
								I created and displayed a video titled ‘How to make a homemade newton meter’ during a 240-people school assembly to raise awareness and get more people involved in our mission.</p>
